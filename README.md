# COVID_NJ_Hispanic
This is a project I completed where I analyzed COVID survey data from, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html, which is the Household Pulse Survey utilized by the US Census. This specific survey was used to determine the mental health state and opinions on different issues related to COVID for US citizens. My analysis specifically was on the mental health ratings of Hispanic residents in New Jersey as compared to non-Hispanic residents and how these mental health ratings related to opinions on COVID related issues. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels.api.
